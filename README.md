This repository stores the MLCC Laboratories for the MLCC (Machine Learning Crash Course) summer school.

This version implements the code in Matlab. Please see another repository for the python implementation.

The labs are based on prior source code available that was develop for the MLCC summer school prior to 2019. This repository is a consequence of all this prior work and is an effort to clean up and centralize the content.

Each laboratory contains a solution file. Please do not jump to that immediately but rather use it as a resource when you are stuck.

All source code was tested with the following setup:
Matlab 2018
Windows 10 and MacOS Mojave

You can download the code locally, but you can also use git. If you are new to using Github please check:

Traversy Media's "Git & GitHub Crash Course For Beginners" available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc

If you are new to Matlab then please check the following resources:

Joseph Delgadillo's "The Complete MATLAB Course: Beginner to Advanced!" available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ekAD7U-wU

Each laboratory has a pdf to guide you through the work. Start there and good luck!
